        <p>
          Hi there, Thanks for visiting my site and checking out my projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          My name is Alex Andres, I am a full stack developer with a keen eye for design and functionality. I like to work on projects that push the limits of my knowledge and challenge me to further explore the world of web development. I focus mainly on front end development at the moment with an emphasis of developing sites with React. I am always  working towards expanding my skillset and am currently learning how to make my development process more succint and efficient with task runners, css preprocessors, and testing tools. 
        </p>

        <p>
          I dove into the world of web development head first in August 2017 by enrolling at web development bootcamp at UCLA. The bootcamp provided a great framework for learning and a broad exposure to many topics in web development. It also provided a great challenge for me as I was balancing working full time and learning in a field that requires hours of daily work to grasp and master. I feel that my skillset is solid but I am always looking to improve, and continually learning new technologies as the field demands.
